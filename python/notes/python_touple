touple

we know that list is a list of element itcan be diffenet data type it can be int str or flot etc 

so we have anther type which is called tuples.
so tuple is almost same as the list but the main differenece is tuple is immuutable but where has list a mutuable.
it means that we cann't change the value of the tuple so tuple is immutable.
mutuable menas we can chanege the value of the list so list is called mutable.
we can change the value of the list or modify the list element by perfomring the some oparation like sort, insert, append, extened etc

the tuple can denoted by using the open and closing braket like this () in that we can spesify the tuple of element.

num = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)

we can read the value of the tuple like 

print(num[0])

output: 1

we can't write the value into the tuple or replace the element of the tuple by onther element for example:

num[0] = 1

it gives the error message like tuple object can not support the item assenment.


tuple support the some function like count function and other one is the ondex.

the count function are used to count particular element that is how many times is repeated in th etuple for example:

t = (1,2,3,4,5,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)

n=t.count(1)
print(n)


the output is :
9
because in this case the 1 is repeted 9 times in the tuple.

example 2:

t = (1,2,3,4,5,6)

n=t.count(2)
print(n)

output is:
1 because in this case 2 is repetedonly one time in the list.



index

the index are used to fetch the particular element index value 


the both index and the count function are called by using the dot opareter. 
for example:

t.index()
t.count()

if some appilication need the set of value cannot change that time we are going with the tuple.
the main advantage of the tuple is the tuple iteration is so fater then the list. so that it will enhance the excusion of seed of the excuation.

 
 tuple can be 1 dimentional 2 dimentional or multi dimention
 
 1d is like : (1,2,3,4,5)
 2d is like : ((1,2,3,4),(3,2,3,2,))
 multidimentional like: 
 (
 (),
 (),
 (),
 .
 .
 .
 .
 .
 .
 ()
 )
 
 and tuple can also be int data type string data type or we can also mix it
 for example:
 
 t = tuple(1,2,3,4) -- data type is of int.
 t = tuple("umesha","ramesha","hugger") string data type.
 t = tuple(2.1,3.2,4.2) data type is of float.
 
 this also work some for other dimention of the tuple also like 2d and multidimentional .
 
 
 example:
 
 t = ((2,3,),(3,22),(5,123,12123.2),("umesha"))
print(t)

output: tuple contained the diferent type of data and which is of multidimentional.
((2, 3), (3, 22), (5, 123, 12123.2), 'umesha')
 
 example:
 
 t = ((2,3,),(3,22),(5.2,123.1,12123.2))
print(t)
 
 
 output:
 
 ((2, 3), (3, 22), (5.2, 123.1, 12123.2))
